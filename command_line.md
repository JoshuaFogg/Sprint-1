What is "Command Line"
Command line allows us users to give commands and receive information with a computer.
It lets us more efficiently run programs and protocols, once we know how to use it.
As it requires a larger knowledge base to use compared to visual navigation, where you can be more experimental.

10 terminal commands and how they can help you:

**"pwd"** means to print working directory. It tells the user where they are currently located within the system directory.

**"atom ."** triggers the launch of the atom.exe. The program can be launched with the current project located at a specified terminal directory already loaded on to Atom.

**"cd"** stands for change directory. This lets the user maneuver between different locations. "cd ~" can be used as a short hand / short cut to maneuver to the root folder of the user.

**"mkdir"** is short for make directory. This command causes a directory or folder to be created at the destination following the command. i.e "mkdir sprint-1" would cause a folder to be made in the current directory with the name "sprint-1".

**"new-item"** can be used to create a new item with the desired attributes. In Linux and Macs systems this is replaced by "touch"

**"ren"** allows a user to rename an item, folder or file to another name.

**"ls"** is used to list all items within the current directory folder.

**"open"** can be used with, "." or a directory location to open either a current folder or a file with it's attributed program.

**"rm"** is a command that is followed by a file name or directory. This command allows you to remove a file or folder from the system. It is also often used with -r or -f to force removal of intended item.

**"ping"** This command allows you to sent a packet of information to a described host. It is used to test connections to sites or servers and to assess speeds for transmitting.

**"pushd" & "popd"** are used to save and recall directory locations. This command set is often used when moving files between locations or navigating multiple locations and wishing to jump between these two sites.
